// NOTE: This file really isn't doing anything. These changes had to be
// made at the package level to propagate. Come up with a better method
// of overriding poorly written TS files. The maintainer of this repo quite
// literally said "IDK" regarding the TS bindings - community made.

// React's ecosystem is heavily driven by support packages so common-use,
// but complex components can be shared and battle tested in libs.
// We will need a standard way to correct and overwrite bad type signatures.

// This package failed with respect to possible nullability. The component example
// provided by the author relies on a state that can be null, but the provided
// TS bindings suggest all of these to be definite. This could also be a reflection
// of my linter using strict non-nullability. HOWEVER, our bindings should be consistent
// and if some packages suggest nullability and others don't, we're definitely losing
// some of the benefits of TypeScript.
